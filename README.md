## Social Scheduler

### App Description
This allows you to see friends' schedules and events for the week. It also allows you to add notes and chat with friends to talk about schedules and availability. This "Groupme and Google calendar" combination will make schedule sharing easier, especially for college students with different classes.

### App Idea Evaluation

- Category: Social platform for sharing schedules
- Mobile: This app uses user availability and location. People can then message each other to grab lunch together. 
- Story: This allows students with busy schedules to more easily find common free time with friends to hang out. This also allows people who are willing to try new things to try with other people.
- Market: College students
- Habit: Update your schedule daily/weekly and share it to your friends to find common free time and hangout together
- Scope: This will be challenging to accomplish. The first shing we do is to find the calendar kit and move further on. Then the group chat and discussion might be easier. But overall, a complicated process awaits.
