## Favorite Exisiting Apps: Categorize and Evaluate
### Snapchat (somehow Instagram apllies)
- **Category**: Social platform for temporary photos and videos
- **Mobile**: Uses camera, can go live on instagram videos and view pictures and videos.
- **Story**: Lets people share their life in the moment
- **Market**: Everyone but mostly young users
- **Habit**: Users, mostly teenagers or people in early twentys will use this app at least once a day
- **Scope**: Snapchat started out very simple to just sending pictures for 10 seconds, but now you can do so much with it. Save pictures, have a folder for memories, and also add to your story for everyone to see.
### Uber/Lyft

- **Mobile**: Relies heavily on mobile, communication and cellular data.

- **Scope**: Uber has always been very simple

### Hopper
- **Category**: Find the best time to book a flight
- **Mobile**: Relies HEAVILY on data and API

## New App Ideas- Evaluate and Categorize
1. Social scheduling app
    - **Description**: Allow you to see your friends schedule and events they have for the week. This app will also allow you to chat in the app and add notes. It's a weekly schedule you can share with friends. (Groupme+ Google calendar)
    - **Category**: Social platform/communication
    - **Mobile**: Uses users availbility and location. They can message each other to grab lunch together.
    - **Story**: Allows people who are willing to try new things to try with other people.
    - **Market**: College students
    - **Habit**: Update your schedule daily/weekly and share it to your friends to find common free time and hangout  together
    - **Scope**: This will be challenging to accomplish. The first shing we do is to find the calendar kit and move further on. Then the group chat and discussion might be easier. But overall, a complicated process awaits.
2. Foonder (Tinder+Food)
    - **Description**: Tinder app but for people who are looking for foodies

    - **Market**: everyone
    - **Habit**: similar to tinder and uber, use it when you need it
    - **Scope**: Easy to do since there are alot of tinder tutorial online
3. Calorie counter healthcare app (Apple Health)
    - **Category**: Health
    - **Mobile**:  Easy tracking on Iphone. We could extend further by integrate with Apple Watch
    - **Story**: Apple Heath but you can share it to your friends and family
    - **Market**: Gymmers and everyone who wants to take initiative of their health
    - **Habit**: Track before and after excercises and meal
    - **Scope**: Hard to do since it's related to calories. We can find an calories API and extend further on. We can evaluate Apple Health and extend it to a different path.
